# SPEC-INFRA-001 — AWS Production Platform (Immutable Terraform IaC)

> **One-line scope.** A reproducible, version-controlled AWS production platform — **Aurora
> PostgreSQL 17 (writer + 2 reader instances, readers are failover targets), EKS, Application/
> Network load balancers, ElastiCache for Redis, and MSK (Kafka, IAM auth)** — spread across **3
> Availability Zones in `us-east-1`** and provisioned end-to-end by **Terraform** under **Immutable
> Infrastructure** discipline (no manual changes; replace-don't-mutate; remote state; plan-in-CI,
> apply behind a CAB gate).
>
> _v0.3.0 resolves §15.7/§15.8: **Aurora PostgreSQL** (not RDS Multi-AZ + async replicas) and **MSK
> IAM authentication** (not SASL/SCRAM or mTLS). See those sections + §1.5._

<!-- Every numbered section is mandatory; (gate) sections are checked by docs/process/gates/phase-gates.yaml.
     This is an INFRASTRUCTURE spec — §8 maps to Terraform module contracts and §9 to the resource/state
     model rather than a REST API. No code is written until status: approved (CLAUDE.md §2). -->

## 1. Context & Problem

### 1.1 Problem statement

The repo already carries a **partial** Terraform footprint under `infrastructure/terraform/`
(modules `networking`, `database`, `cache`, `message-broker`, `kubernetes`, `observability`,
`api-gateway`, `vector-db`, … and `environments/{dev,staging,production}`), but it is **incomplete
and divergent** from this platform's target: the `database` module is a **single** `aws_db_instance`
on **PostgreSQL 16.3** with **no read replicas**, and `message-broker` authenticates with
**SASL/SCRAM**, not TLS. So the real problem is not "nothing exists" — it is that the footprint is
**partial, version-divergent, and not yet the codified production platform**: every environment can
drift, multi-AZ recovery is unrehearsed, PG 17 + read-scaling is missing, and there is no single
authoritative spec. The cost of leaving it: failed audits (ISO 27001 change control), long MTTR,
configuration drift, and an inability to rebuild on demand. **This spec consolidates and completes
the existing tree into the production platform** (see §1.5 for the brownfield reconciliation).

### 1.2 Research / product question

Can the entire production platform be expressed as **versioned Terraform** such that the full
multi-AZ footprint is created (or rebuilt from zero) **automatically, identically, and safely** —
with no manual mutation — and every change flows through plan → review → CAB-gated apply?

### 1.3 Why now / motivation

The application platform (this monorepo) is ready to run on managed AWS services; provisioning is
the gating prerequisite. Doing it as Immutable IaC now avoids accruing manual, undocumented
infrastructure debt that becomes impossible to untangle later, and gives us tested DR and
reproducible non-prod environments from day one.

### 1.4 Deployment topology decision _(decided)_

**`monorepo-services`.** The Terraform lives in this repo under `infrastructure/terraform/`
(alongside the existing `infrastructure/` tree), reusing the repo's CI/CD, DevSecOps gates
(Checkov, SHA-pinned actions, SBOM), CODEOWNERS, and ISO-27001 change management. A standalone
infra repo was rejected — it would fork governance and break the single-pane Spec-as-PR flow.

### 1.5 Brownfield reconciliation _(decided — extend, do not fork)_

This spec **extends the existing `infrastructure/terraform/` modules in place; it does not author a
parallel tree.** Use the **existing module names** (`networking`, `database`, `cache`,
`message-broker`, `kubernetes`, `observability`, …) — the names in §7/§8 are role labels that map
onto them, not new modules. Three concrete deltas are resolved as explicit, ADR-backed decisions
(`new_adrs_required: brownfield-terraform-reconciliation`):

| Delta              | Existing today                                 | Target (this spec)                                           | **Decision (v0.3.0 — resolved)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DB engine + HA     | `database` → single `aws_db_instance`, PG 16.3 | **Aurora PostgreSQL 17 cluster** (writer + 2 readers, FR-02) | **§15.8:** rewrite the `database` module to `aws_rds_cluster` + `aws_rds_cluster_instance`. As data migration is a non-goal (§3), provision **fresh at PG 17** — no in-place 16→17 upgrade needed; **RDS/Aurora Blue/Green** is the documented runbook only for any future data-bearing cutover. |
| MSK authentication | `message-broker` → **SASL/SCRAM**              | **IAM (SASL/IAM)** via IRSA (FR-06)                          | **§15.7:** drop the SCRAM secret + `aws_msk_scram_secret_association`; enable `client_authentication.sasl.iam`; bind per-topic IAM policy to the IRSA role. TLS-in-transit unchanged.                                                                                                            |

State for any retained-data change is **moved with `terraform state mv`**, never destroyed. With
§15.7/§15.8 now decided, these deltas are **no longer blocking**.

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

## 3. Non-Goals / Out of Scope

- **Application workloads** — Helm charts / K8s Deployments for the app services (separate specs;
  this spec delivers the _cluster and data plane_, not what runs on them).
- **Multi-region / active-active DR** — single region (`us-east-1`), multi-AZ only. Cross-region
  replication and failover are future work (§13).
- **CI/CD runner infrastructure** and developer tooling accounts.
- **Data migration** from any existing database into the new RDS.
- **Self-managed Kafka/Redis/Postgres on EC2** — this spec uses AWS **managed** services (MSK,
  ElastiCache, RDS); the managed-vs-self-hosted decision is recorded as a new ADR (§14).
- **FinOps optimization** (savings plans, rightsizing automation) beyond baseline tagging + envelope.

## 4. Consumers & Personas

| Consumer                         | Need from this system                                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Platform / DevOps engineer       | `terraform plan`/`apply` to create & evolve the platform; versioned, reviewable modules           |
| Application services (this repo) | A PostgreSQL endpoint, Redis endpoint, Kafka bootstrap brokers, and an EKS cluster to deploy onto |
| SRE / on-call                    | Multi-AZ HA, CloudWatch golden signals, runbooks, and tested AZ-failure behaviour                 |
| Security / compliance owner      | Evidence of encryption, least-privilege IAM, no public exposure, IaC scan results, change records |
| Release Manager / CAB            | A `terraform plan` artifact to approve before any production `apply` (ISO 27001, ADR-0027)        |

## 5. Functional Requirements

<!-- One testable statement per row; each FR traces to an AC in §12. -->

| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FR-01 | Provision a **VPC** in `us-east-1` spanning **3 AZs** (`us-east-1a/b/c`) with public + private (app) + isolated (data) subnet tiers per AZ, an internet gateway, route tables, **one NAT gateway per AZ in prod** (a single shared NAT allowed in non-prod for cost), and **VPC endpoints** for S3/ECR/Secrets Manager/STS (keep EKS pulls + secret fetches off the NAT/egress path — cost + A10 allow-list).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| FR-02 | Provision an **Aurora PostgreSQL 17 cluster** (§15.8 decision): **1 writer + 2 reader instances**, one per AZ across the 3 AZs, on **shared cluster storage** (sub-second replica lag). The **readers are first-class failover targets** — on writer failure Aurora auto-promotes a reader (~30s) and the **cluster writer endpoint** follows it; apps read via the **cluster reader endpoint** (AWS load-balances across readers). Storage **encrypted with a customer-managed KMS key**; automated backups + PITR; consider **Aurora I/O-Optimized** for steady workloads (§15.1 cost). _HA and read-scaling are the same mechanism here — no async-replica/standby split._ |
| FR-03 | Provision an **EKS** cluster (control plane + managed node groups) with worker nodes **balanced across the 3 AZs**; private API endpoint; IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| NFR-01 | **Immutable infrastructure — scoped honestly by tier.** _Compute_ (EKS node groups, launch templates, AMIs): strictly immutable — changes ship as **replacement** (new launch template / blue-green), never in-place, versioned Bottlerocket/MNG images, no SSH/manual mutation. _Stateful managed services_ (RDS/MSK/ElastiCache): changed via **controlled managed operations** (in-place modify with maintenance window, or **snapshot-restore / blue-green**), **never console mutation** — true destroy-recreate would lose data, so "immutable" here means _no out-of-band change_, not _recreate-on-every-change_ (see §13). |

## 7. Architecture

Single region **`us-east-1`**, three Availability Zones (`a`/`b`/`c`). One VPC, three subnet tiers
per AZ. Managed services for every stateful component; EKS for compute. Provisioned by composable,
versioned Terraform modules with remote state.

  Terraform state: S3 (SSE-KMS, versioned) + DynamoDB lock — per environment
```

> **On the diagram:** read "RDS primary / replica1 / replica2" as the **Aurora cluster** — a
> **writer + 2 reader instances**, one per AZ, over shared cluster storage. The readers **are**
> failover targets (Aurora auto-promotes one on writer failure); the cluster writer/reader
> endpoints abstract which instance is which (FR-02, §15.8).

**Module decomposition — extends the existing tree (§1.5), does not fork it.** The role labels
below map onto the **existing** modules under `infrastructure/terraform/modules/` (keep their
names): `network`→**`networking`** (VPC, subnets, NAT, routes, **VPC endpoints**) ·
`aurora-postgres`→**`database`** (rewritten to `aws_rds_cluster` + 3 `aws_rds_cluster_instance` + KMS + cluster params) ·
`eks`→**`kubernetes`** (cluster, MNG, IRSA, addons) · `loadbalancing` (ALB controller IAM, NLB,
ACM) · `elasticache-redis`→**`cache`** · `msk-kafka`→**`message-broker`** · plus `kms`, `secrets`,
`iam`, **`observability`**, and a `remote-state` bootstrap. Composed per environment under
`environments/<env>/`. Event topology aligns with **ADR-0003** (async streaming via Kafka); any
deviation is a new ADR (§14).

## 8. Terraform Module Contracts _(gate: contract-driven IaC)_

<!-- The "interface" of an IaC change is each module's input variables and output values. These are
     the contract app deploys and other modules depend on — generate/validate, don't hand-drift. -->

| Module              | Key inputs (variables)                                                                                                                                                                 | Key outputs                                                                                                                            |

Outputs of FR-10 are the **stable contract** app-deploy specs (and the EKS workloads) consume;
breaking an output is a versioned, reviewed change.

## 9. Resource & State Model

### 9.1 Resources (managed at boundaries)

VPC + subnets/route tables/NAT/IGW + **VPC endpoints** · **Aurora cluster** (`aws_rds_cluster`) +
**3 `aws_rds_cluster_instance`** (writer + 2 readers) + DB subnet group + cluster parameter group +
KMS key · EKS cluster + managed node groups + OIDC provider + addons (VPC-CNI, CoreDNS, kube-proxy,
EBS-CSI) · ElastiCache replication group + subnet group · MSK cluster + configuration + **IAM
auth** · ALB controller IAM + NLB + ACM cert · Secrets Manager secrets · KMS CMKs · IAM
roles/policies (incl. **per-topic MSK IAM** for IRSA) · CloudWatch alarms/log groups · security groups.

### 9.2 State convention _(define once; all environments agree)_

Remote backend `s3://<org>-tfstate-<account>/<env>/<region>/terraform.tfstate`, **SSE-KMS**,
**versioned**, **DynamoDB lock table** `terraform-locks`. One state per environment; modules are
shared and pinned. State is **never** committed to git (NFR-09).

### 9.3 Retention

RDS automated backups + PITR (7-day prod / 1-day non-prod) plus a monthly manual snapshot kept 1
year; MSK + ElastiCache daily snapshots, 7-day retention; S3 state versioning retains prior states;
CloudWatch log retention 90 d (prod) / 30 d (non-prod). See §15 for the (illustrative) resolved
values — re-confirm at the cost/compliance gate for a real run.

### 9.4 Governance/response metadata

Every resource is tagged (FR-09) so cost, owner, and the governing spec are queryable from the AWS
console/Cost Explorer; the `terraform plan` JSON is the change artifact attached to the CAB record.

## 10. Golden Signals & SLO Definitions _(gate: observability)_

These are the **platform-plane** signals this spec owns (per ADR-0004 Observability Stack).
Application-plane request signals (ALB 5xx, `TargetResponseTime` per service) belong to the
workloads that run on the platform — **out of scope** here (§3) and owned by the app specs.

| Signal     | Derivation (platform infra)                                                                                                                 | Exposed as               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Traffic    | MSK `BytesIn/Out`; RDS connections; Redis ops/sec; NAT `BytesOut`; ALB `ActiveFlowCount`                                                    | throughput/conn counts   |
| Latency    | Aurora read/write latency; **`AuroraReplicaLag`** (sub-second, reader freshness); Redis latency; ALB `TargetResponseTime` (infra view only) | P50 / P95 / P99          |
| Error      | RDS failed connections + failover events; MSK under-replicated/offline partitions; ElastiCache failovers; unhealthy-host count              | error_rate / event count |
| Saturation | RDS CPU/FreeableStorage/IOPS; EKS node CPU/mem + pod headroom; Redis evictions/memory; MSK disk; **NAT GW throughput**                      | saturation_pct, headroom |

SLO targets recorded in `docs/sre/slo/slo.yaml` (e.g. RDS availability ≥ 99.95%, ElastiCache ≥
99.9%, MSK under-replicated-partitions = 0, **`AuroraReplicaLag` < N ms**). CloudWatch alarms page
on breach; an AZ-failure test (§12 AC-09) validates the **Aurora auto-failover** SLO. PRR ≥ 90%
before production promotion.

**STRIDE over the untrusted boundaries** (internet→ALB, and the Terraform state/apply pipeline):
ALB is the only internet-facing surface (TLS + optional WAF); data stores are isolated-subnet +
SG-scoped (Spoofing/Tampering/Info-disclosure mitigated); state is encrypted + locked + access-
controlled (Tampering/EoP); apply is least-privilege via a scoped CI role (EoP). No `src/agents/`
or `src/guardrails/` surface → Phase 10 (AI Safety) is **N/A** for this spec.

## 12. Acceptance Criteria _(gate: dry-run validation)_

<!-- Each observable & runnable; these become the dry-run evidence in /deliver's FINAL-REPORT. -->

| ID    | Acceptance criterion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AC-01 | `terraform fmt -check` and `terraform validate` pass for every module and environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| AC-02 | **Checkov/tfsec** scan reports **zero** CRITICAL/HIGH findings (or each is documented + risk-accepted).                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| AC-03 | `terraform plan` from an empty state proposes the full §7 footprint; a second `plan` on the applied state is **empty modulo a documented `lifecycle.ignore_changes` allow-list** (managed services emit known perpetual diffs — the allow-list is reviewed, not silently growing).                 |
| AC-04 | `aws rds describe-db-clusters` shows an **`aurora-postgresql`** engine at version **17** with **1 writer + 2 reader** cluster members in **3 distinct AZs**, `StorageEncrypted=true` with the CMK, and `Endpoint`/`ReaderEndpoint` both resolving.                                                 |
| AC-05 | EKS worker nodes are present in **all 3 AZs**; the cluster API endpoint is **private**; IRSA OIDC provider exists.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| AC-06 | ElastiCache Redis has **Multi-AZ automatic failover**, `TransitEncryptionEnabled=true`, `AtRestEncryptionEnabled=true`, nodes across 3 AZs.                                                                                                                                                        |
| AC-07 | MSK cluster has **3 brokers across 3 AZs**, encryption-in-transit = TLS, encryption-at-rest with the CMK, **`client_authentication.sasl.iam = true`** (no SCRAM/unauthenticated); the `bootstrap_brokers_sasl_iam` endpoint resolves and a pod with the bound IRSA role can produce/consume.       |
| AC-08 | No data-plane service (RDS/Redis/MSK) is reachable from `0.0.0.0/0`; security groups allow only the EKS node/pod SG.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| AC-09 | **AZ-failure drill:** `failover-db-cluster` (or simulated AZ loss) auto-promotes a **reader to writer** (~30s); the **cluster writer endpoint** follows it and keeps serving with no manual step (Aurora — readers are failover targets); ElastiCache/MSK remain available. Failover RTO recorded. |
| AC-10 | The **same modules** build a `staging` environment from a different tfvars file with no module edits, and a **timed full rebuild completes ≤ 2 h** (validates G-04).                                                                                                                               |
| AC-11 | Every provisioned resource carries the mandatory tag set (`environment`, `owner`, `cost-center`, `managed-by=terraform`, `spec=SPEC-INFRA-001`).                                                                                                                                                   |
| AC-12 | No secret appears in `terraform output`, state, or CI logs in plaintext; the **RDS master password is RDS-managed** (`manage_master_user_password`, absent from state) and Redis/MSK credentials resolve from Secrets Manager.                                                                     |
| AC-13 | _(traces FR-04)_ An **internet-facing ALB** exists with an **ACM cert** and an HTTPS listener terminating **TLS 1.2+**; where L4 is required an **NLB** is present; the AWS Load Balancer Controller IRSA role is bound.                                                                           |
| AC-14 | _(traces FR-10)_ Every §8 module **output resolves non-empty** (`terraform output` for `writer_endpoint`, `reader_endpoints`, `cluster_name`, `oidc_provider_arn`, Redis `primary_endpoint`, `bootstrap_brokers_tls`) — the app-deploy contract is satisfiable.                                    |

## 13. Risks & Limitations

- **Single region.** `us-east-1` only — a full-region outage is not covered. Documented exit path:
  **Aurora Global Database** (cross-region) + Route53 failover (future ADR). Record as an explicit
  consequence, not a silent assumption.
- **Managed-service constraints.** Aurora reader lag is sub-second but non-zero under write bursts;
  MSK/ElastiCache patching windows can cause brief failovers — surface in runbooks.
- **Cost.** A 3-AZ managed footprint (Aurora writer + 2 readers (I/O-Optimized), MSK 3-broker, ElastiCache MAZ,
  EKS, NAT×3) is non-trivial; non-prod must be sized down and the envelope tracked (G-06/ADR-0020).
- **Stateful "immutability" is bounded (NFR-01).** Compute is genuinely immutable (node groups
  replaced); data stores are **not** recreated on change — they use in-place managed ops or
  snapshot-restore/blue-green. The claim is "no out-of-band mutation," not "recreate every change."
- **Aurora trade-offs (FR-02/§15.8).** Aurora resolves the readers-as-failover-targets need but
  costs ~15–25% over plain RDS (mitigated by I/O-Optimized) and is **not byte-for-byte vanilla PG**
  (rare extension/version gaps) — accept the mild lock-in for the HA+read fit, or fall back to the
  RDS Multi-AZ DB cluster (§15.8 runner-up).
- **Brownfield migration risk (§1.5).** The existing `database` module (`aws_db_instance`, PG 16.3)
  is **rewritten to an Aurora cluster** and `message-broker` auth flips **SCRAM→IAM**. As data
  migration is a non-goal (§3) this is a fresh provision, not a live cutover; perpetual-diff
  `ignore_changes` lists must be reviewed (AC-03), not silently grown.
- **Apply blast radius.** A bad `apply` can affect production; mitigated by plan-in-PR + CAB gate +
  per-environment state isolation + targeted applies.

## 14. ADR & Dependency Impact

- **Reuses:** ADR-0003 (async/Kafka), ADR-0004 (observability stack — §10 platform signals),
  ADR-0012 (PII masking — data the platform stores), ADR-0018 (encryption at rest), ADR-0019
  (Redis TLS + value encryption), ADR-0020 (cost-allocation **tagging discipline**, not its LLM
  budget), ADR-0026 (SOX audit-log immutability — _only if_ a financial path lands here),
  ADR-0027 (ISO-27001 change management), ADR-0029 (DevSecOps/IaC scanning).
- **Adds** (authored in Phase 5): `immutable-infrastructure-terraform` (replace-not-mutate,
  tier-scoped), `aws-three-az-region-topology` (VPC/subnet/AZ design), `terraform-remote-state-
management` (S3+DynamoDB backend, isolation, locking), `managed-services-selection-rds-msk-
elasticache` (managed vs self-hosted + exit paths), **`brownfield-terraform-reconciliation`**
  (extend-not-fork; **decided** v0.3.0: `database`→Aurora cluster + MSK SCRAM→IAM; fresh-provision,
  not in-place — §1.5/§15.7), and **`rds-availability-model-multiaz-vs-aurora`** (**decided** v0.3.0:
  **Aurora PostgreSQL**; RDS Multi-AZ DB cluster the documented runner-up — §15.8).
- **Produces:** Terraform modules + environments under `infrastructure/terraform/`,
  `.terraform.lock.hcl` (pinned), a Checkov policy/baseline, module input/output docs, a
  resource-inventory/SBOM artifact, runbook stubs (Aurora failover, AZ loss, Blue/Green DB upgrade, state recovery), and
  `slo.yaml` entries for the platform golden signals.

## 15. Open Questions

<!-- Resolved at a HITL gate, not assumed. /deliver lists these as open-HITL items. -->

> ⚠️ **Illustrative example values — this is a template/demo spec.** The six items below carry
> **fake, plausible** answers to show a fully-resolved spec; they are **not** real production
> decisions. A real run must re-decide each at the §11 CAB gate and replace these figures.

1. **Instance sizing & cost envelope** _(resolved — example)_: **Aurora** `db.r6g.2xlarge` writer +
   2× `db.r6g.xlarge` readers, **I/O-Optimized**; **EKS** `m6i.2xlarge` managed nodes, 2/AZ (6
   baseline) autoscaling 6–15; **MSK** `kafka.m5.large` ×3, 1 TB/broker; **Redis** `cache.r6g.xlarge`,
   1 primary + 2 replicas. Cost envelope (example): **prod ≈ \$7,200/mo** (Aurora + I/O-Optimized is
   ~15–25% over plain RDS), **staging ≈ \$2,000/mo**, **dev ≈ \$800/mo**. (Figures fabricated for the example.)
2. **MSK mode** _(resolved — example)_: **KRaft** (no ZooKeeper) on **provisioned** MSK (not
   Serverless) — predictable cost and broker-level tuning at the expected throughput.
3. **Backup/retention windows** _(resolved — example)_: RDS **PITR 7 days** (prod) / 1 day
   (non-prod); automated snapshots 7 d + a **monthly manual snapshot kept 1 year**; MSK & Redis
   daily snapshots, 7-day retention; CloudWatch logs **90 d** (prod) / 30 d (non-prod).
4. **WAF on the ALB** _(resolved — example)_: **Yes — AWS WAFv2** web ACL on the internet-facing
   ALB in prod (AWS managed rule groups: Common, SQLi, Known-Bad-Inputs + a rate-based rule).
5. **Multi-account strategy** _(resolved — example)_: **Separate AWS accounts per environment**
   under **AWS Organizations + Control Tower** (`dev`/`staging`/`prod` + a central logging
   account); environments isolated by account, not just VPC.
6. **Terraform execution** _(resolved — example)_: **GitHub Actions with OIDC-assumed IAM role**
   (no long-lived keys) — `plan` on PR, `apply` on merge gated by environment protection + a
   CAB-approved RFC (ADR-0027); reuses the repo's existing OIDC/SHA-pinned-actions posture.

> ✅ **Resolved in v0.3.0** — the two formerly-blocking architectural decisions (these were real,
> not example-fillable). Each becomes its named ADR in §14.

7. **Brownfield deltas (§1.5) — DECIDED.** (a) PG **16.3 → 17**: provision **fresh at PG 17**
   (data migration is a non-goal, §3); **Aurora/RDS Blue/Green** is the runbook reserved for any
   future data-bearing cutover — no in-place 16→17 upgrade. (b) MSK auth: **IAM (SASL/IAM) via
   IRSA** — _not_ mTLS (avoids ACM Private CA cost/cert-lifecycle) and _not_ SCRAM (no shared
   secret); TLS-in-transit stays. FR-06 amended accordingly.
8. **DB availability model (FR-02) — DECIDED: Aurora PostgreSQL.** Aurora's reader instances _are_
   auto-failover targets with sub-second lag and clean cluster reader/writer endpoints — it
   delivers the spec's HA+read intent natively (no async-replica/manual-promotion gap). _Runner-up
   if Aurora is ever rejected on cost/lock-in: **RDS Multi-AZ DB cluster** (1 writer + 2 readable
   standbys, vanilla PG, capped at 2 readers)._ Drives FR-02/AC-04/AC-09 and the §10 lag SLO.
