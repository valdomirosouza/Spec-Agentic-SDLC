# Product Vision

**Status:** Approved | **Owner:** Product Owner | **Last updated:** 2026-05-24

---

## Problem Statement

Enterprise teams operating at scale face a growing gap between the volume of decisions
they must make and the human capacity to make them thoughtfully. Routine tasks —
data classification, document processing, status updates, notification routing —
consume time that could be directed at higher-value work. Existing automation tools
either require deep technical expertise to configure or lack the accountability
controls (audit trails, human oversight, compliance documentation) required in
regulated environments.

---

## Vision Statement

An enterprise AI-powered system that augments human decision-making by automating
routine tasks with full auditability, human oversight for consequential actions,
and built-in compliance with LGPD, GDPR, and EU AI Act requirements — so that teams
can move faster without sacrificing accountability.

## Goals and Success Metrics

| Goal                                             | Metric                              | Target                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Reduce time-to-decision for routine requests     | Average request processing time     | < 2 minutes (vs. current baseline)     |
| Maintain human control for consequential actions | HITL coverage for HIGH-risk actions | 100% — no exceptions                   |
| Achieve and maintain reliability SLO             | API availability                    | ≥ 99.9% over 30 days                   |
| Protect personal data                            | PII leakage incidents               | Zero in production                     |
| Enable team confidence in AI output              | HITL rejection rate trend           | Decreasing over time as model improves |

---

## Non-Goals

This system explicitly does **not**:

- Replace human judgement for irreversible or high-stakes decisions (HITL is mandatory)
- Process unmasked personal data through external LLM APIs
- Operate without an audit trail for any agent action
- Provide general-purpose AI assistant functionality outside the documented use cases
- Guarantee real-time processing (async-first architecture; latency SLOs apply)

## Target Users

| Persona                   | Role                                               | Core job-to-be-done                                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operations analyst**    | Processes routine requests, reviews HITL approvals | Review and approve/reject agent-proposed actions quickly, with full context       |
| **Knowledge worker**      | Submits requests; receives processed results       | Submit a request and get a reliable, auditable result without technical knowledge |
| **Compliance officer**    | Audits system behaviour                            | Query the audit log to confirm all decisions were appropriately reviewed          |
| **SRE / DevOps engineer** | Maintains system reliability                       | Monitor Golden Signals; execute rollback; complete PRR before deployments         |

## Key Constraints

| Constraint                                             | Source                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| PII must be masked before LLM ingestion                | ADR-0012, LGPD Art. 46, GDPR Art. 25 |
| HITL required for all consequential agent actions      | ADR-0011, EU AI Act Art. 14          |
| All agent actions must be auditable                    | LGPD Art. 37, GDPR Art. 5(2)         |
| System must meet SLO targets before production release | PRR checklist                        |
| DPIA and RIPD required before processing personal data | LGPD Art. 38, GDPR Art. 35           |

## Strategic Alignment

This system supports the following organisational objectives:

- **Operational efficiency:** reduce manual effort for routine high-volume tasks
- **Regulatory compliance:** demonstrate LGPD/GDPR/EU AI Act compliance to auditors
- **Risk management:** human oversight for all consequential automated decisions
- **Trust:** auditability and transparency build confidence in AI-assisted workflows

## Top Strategic Risks

| Risk                                         | Likelihood | Mitigation                                               |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| HITL approval latency exceeds SLO            | Medium     | SLO-driven alerting; reviewer training; escalation path  |
| LLM provider outage disrupts service         | Medium     | Fallback mode; provider redundancy plan                  |
| PII leakage through LLM or logs              | Low        | Mandatory masking; automated leakage tests               |
| Regulatory requirement changes (LGPD/GDPR)   | Low        | DPO monitors regulatory updates; quarterly policy review |
| Low HITL adoption (reviewers skip approvals) | Medium     | UX design; mandatory approval flow; audit monitoring     |
