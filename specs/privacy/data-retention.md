## Implementation Requirements

### Automated Deletion

All time-bounded retention tiers must be enforced by automated jobs — manual deletion is not acceptable for compliance.

| Mechanism                | Used for                              | Implementation                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| PostgreSQL TTL job       | L1/L2 masked fields in application DB | Scheduled job; `DELETE WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL` |
| Kafka topic TTL          | All Kafka topics                      | Topic config: `retention.ms`                                |
| Redis TTL                | Session and cache keys                | Key-level TTL set at write time                             |
| Log aggregator TTL       | Structured logs                       | Index/stream TTL configuration                              |
| Object storage lifecycle | Backup snapshots                      | Bucket lifecycle policy                                     |

### Deletion Verification

After every scheduled deletion run:

1. Log the count of records deleted per category
2. Spot-check: confirm no records older than retention threshold remain
3. Emit metric: `data_retention_deleted_total{category}` and `data_retention_overdue_total{category}`
4. Alert if `data_retention_overdue_total > 0` for any L1/L2 category

---

## Right to Erasure (LGPD Art. 18 / GDPR Art. 17)

When a data subject submits an erasure request:

1. DPO receives and validates the request
2. Engineering identifies all systems containing the subject's data (use PII inventory as guide)
3. Hard-delete L1/L2 fields from PostgreSQL within **15 days**
4. Invalidate Vector DB embeddings derived from subject's data
5. Pseudonymise or redact audit records (audit structure preserved; subject fields replaced with `[ERASED]`)
6. Confirm deletion to DPO in writing
7. DPO responds to data subject within **15 days** of request (LGPD requirement)

**Exception:** Audit records required for legal proceedings are retained per legal hold; DPO must approve any legal hold extension.

---

## Quarterly Review

DPO reviews retention compliance quarterly:

1. Verify automated deletion jobs ran successfully (check `data_retention_deleted_total` metrics)
2. Confirm no L1/L2 records exceed retention threshold
3. Review any erasure requests received and confirm timely completion
4. Update retention schedule if regulatory requirements changed
5. Document review outcome in `docs/postmortems/YYYY-MM-DD-retention-review.md`

---

## Legal Hold Procedure

When a legal hold is required:

1. Legal team notifies DPO + Tech Lead in writing
2. Tech Lead creates a hold record identifying the data in scope
3. Automated deletion is suspended for held data only
4. Hold is reviewed quarterly; lifted when legal proceeding concludes
5. On lift: normal retention schedule resumes; overdue records deleted within 30 days
