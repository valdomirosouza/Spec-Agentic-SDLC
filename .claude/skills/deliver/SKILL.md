  Drive ONE feature spec through the full 15-phase Agentic Spec-Driven Delivery
  workflow (ADR-0058) in one of two modes: DRY-RUN (governed simulation, no real
  side-effects) or CODE (real implementation into the working tree, still stopping
  at every human gate). Trigger on "deliver", "deliver a spec", "15-phase",
  "Agentic SDLC", "dry-run delivery", or "delivery report". Usage:
  /deliver [dry-run|code] [tier] [language] <path-to-spec.md> — mode defaults to
  dry-run, tier defaults to GOVERNED (the SCOPE axis, ADR-0064: TRIVIAL|STANDARD|
  GOVERNED|REGULATED — right-sizes which process phases run; control phases always run),
  language defaults to PYTHON; declare JAVA, GO, NODE, TYPESCRIPT, IAC (Terraform/
  Ansible), or another stack to build the spec in that language. Produces a plan, a
  decomposed backlog, per-phase execution via the phase-executor subagent, and a
  FINAL-REPORT with requirement-traceability, agent timing, and a human-vs-agent
  speedup ratio. Never invents a spec; never autonomously merges, pushes, releases,
  deploys, or changes autonomy flags.

# /deliver — Agentic Spec-Driven Delivery orchestrator (DRY-RUN | CODE)

You orchestrate one feature spec through the repo's **15-phase Agentic Spec-Driven
Delivery** lifecycle, delegating each phase to the `phase-executor` subagent. This is a
**thin** orchestrator: it points to repo knowledge and does **not** restate phase criteria —
the executor reads them per phase.

## Argument parsing — mode + tier + language + spec path

`$ARGUMENTS` is `[<mode>] [<tier>] [<language>] <path-to-spec.md>` (case-insensitive). Canonical
order is mode, then tier, then language, then spec — but parse **by classifying tokens**, so
order/omission is tolerated:

- **`<mode>`** ∈ {`dry-run`, `code`} (aliases: `dryrun`, `dry_run` → `dry-run`). **Default `dry-run`.**
- **`<tier>`** ∈ {`TRIVIAL`, `STANDARD`, `GOVERNED`, `REGULATED`} (case-insensitive) — the **scope
  axis** (ADR-0064). It right-sizes which **process** phases run; **control phases always run in
  every tier** (`phase-gates.yaml › phases[*].applicability.control_phase: true`). **Default
  `GOVERNED`** (conservative — omission never under-governs). Read the authoritative tier→phase
  mapping from `docs/process/gates/phase-gates.yaml` (`tiers:`, each phase's `applicability:`
  block, and `escalation_triggers:`); do not restate it here.
- **`<language>`** — the stack the spec is built in. **Default `PYTHON`.** Recognised keywords
  (normalise to the canonical name on the left):
  - `PYTHON` ← python, py
  - `JAVA` ← java (Spring Boot)
  - `GO` ← go, golang
  - `NODE` ← node, nodejs, javascript, js
  - `TYPESCRIPT` ← typescript, ts
  - `IAC` ← iac, terraform, ansible, infra (infrastructure-as-code)
  - **other** — any token that is neither a mode nor the spec path is taken as the declared
    language verbatim (upper-cased) and built best-effort in that stack.

**Procedure:**

1. Split `$ARGUMENTS` on whitespace. **`SPEC`** = the token that ends in `.md` (or contains `/`);
   if none, the **last** token. The other 0–3 leading tokens are mode, tier, and/or language.
2. Classify each remaining token: a mode keyword → `MODE`; a tier keyword
   (`TRIVIAL`|`STANDARD`|`GOVERNED`|`REGULATED`, case-insensitive) → `TIER`; otherwise →
   `LANGUAGE` (normalised). Unset → defaults (`MODE=dry-run`, `TIER=GOVERNED`, `LANGUAGE=PYTHON`).
   If two tokens both classify to the same axis (two modes / two tiers / two languages), report
   the ambiguity and ask.
3. **If no spec path remains, ask the user for the spec path and stop** — never invent or
   fabricate a spec. If the path does not exist, report that and stop (the spec must exist
   before delivery).
4. Echo the resolved mode, tier, language, and spec back before doing anything, e.g.
   `Mode: CODE · Tier: STANDARD · Language: JAVA · Spec: specs/foo.md`. For `code`, also state
   the gate boundary up front (see **Modes** below). State which **process** phases the tier
   waives and that **control phases run regardless** (ADR-0064; resolve the per-phase
   `applicability` from `phase-gates.yaml`). For a non-PYTHON language, note the canonical
   location + validation targets it maps to (see **Languages**).

## Tier ↔ risk class (one mapping, W13-T6)

The DoR assigns a **risk class** (ADR-0058 Phase 0); `/deliver` takes a **tier** (ADR-0064 scope
axis). They are different axes — risk class says *how dangerous*, tier says *how big* — and the
tier can never go **below** the floor its risk class implies:

| Risk class (DoR)          | Minimum tier | Notes                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| small fix                 | TRIVIAL      | may be raised to STANDARD by the ADR-0064 safety valve             |
| normal feature            | STANDARD     |                                                                    |
| high-risk feature         | GOVERNED     |                                                                    |
| AI/LLM/agentic feature    | GOVERNED     | REGULATED if it touches `src/guardrails/` or the HITL gateway      |
| security-sensitive        | REGULATED    |                                                                    |
| infrastructure/platform   | GOVERNED     | REGULATED for production-affecting Terraform / feature-flag change |

A run whose declared tier is below the floor emits `TIER_ESCALATION` at Phase 0.

## Modes

| Mode                  | What the executor does                                                                                                                      | Writes to                                                                                                     | Validation                                                                                                     | Human gates                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DRY-RUN** (default) | Drafts each phase's artefact into the report sandbox; simulates every gated action                                                          | `reports/<SLUG>/` **only** — never `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `infrastructure/`, `.github/`                   | Runs the repo's read-only validation targets for evidence                                                      | Auto-approved **and logged** (`HITL: auto-approved (dry-run)`); never silently bypassed               |
| **CODE**              | Implements the spec for real: writes code, tests, ADRs, docs, and migrations into their canonical locations; runs the real validation suite | The **real working tree** (`src/`, `tests/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/`, migrations, etc.) — **local, uncommitted** | Runs the real lint/test/security/contract targets; a failing required gate **stops** that phase (`gate: FAIL`) | **Enforced for real** — the run **STOPS** at every human gate and never proceeds past it autonomously |

**CODE-mode hard boundary (non-negotiable, CLAUDE.md §3, §14; ADR-0011/0034).** Even in
CODE mode you implement and prepare, but you **never** autonomously perform an outward-facing
or irreversible action. The run **STOPS and waits for explicit human approval** at every one
of these gates and does not continue past it on its own:

- `git push`, opening/merging a PR, creating a tag or GitHub Release (Phases 7, 12, 13).
- Any deploy, rollback, or canary promotion (Phases 12–13).
- Any feature-flag / autonomy / ACL / permission change (ADR-0015).
- Any action `src/agents/hitl_gateway.py` would intercept, or any `CLAUDE.md §14` trigger
  (e.g. modifying `>3` ADRs, touching `src/guardrails/` or `hitl_gateway.py`, coverage
  dropping `<75%`, a missing spec after two searches).

In CODE mode these are **real STOPs** (emit the gate line, stop file writes, wait). In DRY-RUN
they are simulated-and-logged. In **neither** mode do you push, merge, release, deploy, or
change a flag without a human explicitly approving in this session.

## Languages

`LANGUAGE` selects the stack the spec is implemented in (CODE) and the validation targets used for
evidence (both modes). It does **not** change any gate, guardrail, or human-stop — only **where**
code lands and **which** `make` targets run. Default `PYTHON`.

| LANGUAGE                    | CODE writes to                                            | Evidence (make) targets                                                                                                              | Scaffold                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **PYTHON** (default)        | `src/` + `tests/`                                         | `make lint-python` · `make test-unit-python` · `make test-security-python`                                                           | (active core)                            |
| **JAVA**                    | `services/<name>/` (Spring Boot)                          | `make lint-java SERVICE=<name>` · `make test-unit-java SERVICE=<name>`                                                               | `make new-service NAME=<name> LANG=java` |
| **GO**                      | `services/<name>/`                                        | `make lint-go SERVICE=<name>` · `make test-unit-go SERVICE=<name>`                                                                   | `make new-service NAME=<name> LANG=go`   |
| **NODE** / **TYPESCRIPT**   | `frontend/<app>/` (Next.js)                               | `make lint-frontend APP=<app>` · `make test-unit-frontend APP=<app>`                                                                 | (frontend template)                      |
| **IAC** (Terraform/Ansible) | `infrastructure/`                                         | `terraform fmt -check` + `terraform validate` + Checkov (`make`/CI), or `ansible-lint` — see `skills/devsecops/pipeline-security.md` | n/a                                      |
| **other**                   | the stack's conventional layout (note it in `00-plan.md`) | the stack's standard lint + unit targets; if the repo has no target, run the toolchain directly and **document the gap**             | per the stack                            |

- **Cross-cutting gates are language-agnostic** — DevSecOps (SAST/SCA/SBOM), AI-safety, OTel,
  privacy/PII, coverage ≥80%, and every human gate apply regardless of `LANGUAGE`. Only the lint/
  unit/build evidence commands and the code location change.
- Register a new `services/`/`frontend/` entry in `services.yaml` and `.github/CODEOWNERS` per
  CLAUDE.md §0 (CODE mode drafts these; they are not outward-facing actions, so no human STOP —
  but treat editing `.github/CODEOWNERS`/workflows with care).
- If `LANGUAGE` is unknown to the repo (no matching `make` target), still implement it best-effort
  in that stack and **log the missing-target gap** in the affected phase rather than failing.

## Ground truth (read these; do not restate them in this file)

- `CLAUDE.md` — the behavioural contract (§2 SDD cycle, §3 inviolable rules, §14 escalation).
- `docs/process/gates/phase-gates.yaml` — the **authoritative** 15 phase definitions, required
  artifacts, required approvals, allowed/prohibited actions, exit criteria.
- `docs/process/WORKFLOW.md` — the human-readable 15-phase lifecycle (ADR-0058).
- `specs/sdlc/development-lifecycle.md` — the 5-stage view (Spec→Implement→Verify→Stage→Produce).
- `docs/adr/README.md` — ADR index, for phase→ADR mapping (esp. ADR-0058, 0052, 0034, 0011).
- `src/agents/hitl_gateway.py` — where HITL interception happens (ADR-0011; timeout always rejects).
- `Makefile` / `README.md` — the real validation targets used for evidence.
- `specs/SPEC-TEMPLATE.md` — the canonical spec template; well-formed specs follow it and its
  `§N → phase` map mirrors this procedure. If the spec is missing key sections, note the gap in
  the affected phase rather than inventing content.

## The 15 phases (exact names, from phase-gates.yaml — run in dependency order)

`0` Intake & Prioritization · `1` Conception · `2` Discovery · `3` Grooming ·
`4` Specification · `5` Architecture · `6` Development · `7` Code Review · `8` Testing ·
`9` Security & DevSecOps · `10` AI Safety & Agent Governance · `11` Observability &
Operational Readiness · `12` Release Candidate · `13` Production Deployment ·
`14` Post-Deployment & Learn.

Phase 10 is **conditional** (`ai_or_agent_change`): if the spec touches neither `src/agents/`
nor `src/guardrails/` nor a new `action_type`/autonomy, record it `N/A` and continue without a gate.

## Procedure

Let `SLUG` = the spec filename without extension. All output goes under `reports/<SLUG>/`.

### Phase 0 — Plan, then STOP at the first HITL gate

1. Read `CLAUDE.md`, the spec at `$ARGUMENTS`, `specs/sdlc/development-lifecycle.md`, and
   `docs/process/gates/phase-gates.yaml`. **Record the tracked-tree baseline** now:
   `git status --porcelain` → `reports/<SLUG>/logs/00-tree-baseline.txt` (the set of files
   already dirty before the run; used by the DRY-RUN snapshot-and-restore invariant below).
2. Write `reports/<SLUG>/00-plan.md`: the resolved `MODE`, `TIER`, and `LANGUAGE` (+ the canonical
   code location and validation targets that language maps to — see **Languages**), problem
   summary, risk class, the 15-phase plan with the governing ADR(s) per phase **and each phase's
   `required`/`conditional`/`waivable` status for `TIER`** (resolved from `phase-gates.yaml ›
phases[*].applicability`; mark waived process phases `PHASE_WAIVED` with a reason, and list the
   `escalation_triggers` that would promote the tier mid-run — ADR-0064), the guardrails in scope,
   the evidence strategy, and — for `code` — the list of human gates where the run will STOP.
   **Control phases (`applicability.control_phase: true`) are listed as running in every tier.**
3. Decompose the spec into `reports/<SLUG>/backlog.yaml` — a list of items, each with:
   `id`, `title`, `phase` (0–14), `depends_on` (list of ids), `adr_refs` (list),
   `acceptance` (testable criteria), `estimate_tshirt` (XS|S|M|L|XL).
4. Emit a HITL gate and **STOP** before executing any phase:
   `HITL-GATE phase=0 reason="plan approval required before execution"`.
   - **DRY-RUN:** after recording the gate, proceed and log `HITL: auto-approved (dry-run)`
     with the plan payload.
   - **CODE:** this is a **real STOP** — present the plan + backlog + gate list and **wait for
     the human to approve** before launching any phase. Do not begin Phase 1 until approved.

### Phases 1–14 — delegate each to the phase-executor subagent

For each phase in dependency order, launch the subagent with a **narrow** brief via the Task tool:

```
Task(subagent_type="phase-executor", description="Phase <N> — <name>", prompt="""
PHASE: <N> — <exact phase name>
SPEC: <SPEC>
SLUG: <SLUG>
MODE: <DRY-RUN | CODE>   # emit the CANONICAL upper-case token (normalise dry-run/dryrun/code first)
TIER: <TRIVIAL | STANDARD | GOVERNED | REGULATED>   # scope axis (ADR-0064); default GOVERNED
  (Resolve this phase's applicability for TIER from phase-gates.yaml id=<N> applicability:
   required → run it; conditional → run only if its `condition` holds, else record N/A;
   waivable → skip ONLY if control_phase is false, emitting `PHASE_WAIVED: phase=<N> tier=<TIER>
   reason=<…>`. control_phase:true phases run in EVERY tier — never waive a control phase.
   If a safety-valve trigger fires mid-phase (scope-ceiling/coverage-drop/new-dependency/
   control-trigger-fired/task-expansion/guardrail-touch), return a TIER_ESCALATION line so the
   orchestrator promotes the tier and re-enters skipped phases.)
LANGUAGE: <PYTHON | JAVA | GO | NODE | TYPESCRIPT | IAC | other>   # the stack to build in + validate
  (CODE writes to that language's canonical location; evidence uses its make targets — see Languages.
   PYTHON→src/+tests/; JAVA/GO→services/<name>/; NODE/TS→frontend/<app>/; IAC→infrastructure/)
BACKLOG_IDS: <ids whose phase == N>
GOVERNING_ADRS: <from phase-gates.yaml / docs/adr/README.md>
GATE_CRITERIA: read docs/process/gates/phase-gates.yaml id=<N> (required_artifacts,
  required_approvals, exit_criteria, allowed/prohibited actions, applicability for TIER)
GUARDRAILS: CLAUDE.md §3 + src/guardrails/ relevant to this phase
MODE CONTRACT:
  - DRY-RUN — no real side-effects. Draft artefacts into reports/<SLUG>/ only; never touch
    src/, tests/, docs/, infrastructure/, .github/. Simulate-and-log every gated action.
  - CODE — implement for real in the LANGUAGE's canonical location (PYTHON→src/+tests/;
    JAVA/GO→services/<name>/; NODE/TS→frontend/<app>/; IAC→infrastructure/; + docs/adr/, docs/,
    migrations). Run the real validation suite; a failing required gate ⇒ gate: FAIL.
    NEVER push/merge/tag/release/deploy or change a flag/ACL/autonomy — return those as a
    BLOCKED human gate for the orchestrator to STOP on. Honour every CLAUDE.md §14 trigger
    and any action src/agents/hitl_gateway.py would intercept as a real STOP.
EVIDENCE: validate with the LANGUAGE-appropriate make targets (PYTHON: lint-python/
  test-unit-python/test-security-python · JAVA: lint-java/test-unit-java SERVICE=<name> ·
  GO: lint-go/test-unit-go SERVICE=<name> · NODE|TS: lint-frontend/test-unit-frontend APP=<app> ·
  IAC: terraform fmt/validate + Checkov, or ansible-lint · other: the stack's standard lint+unit —
  if no repo target exists, run the toolchain directly and log the gap). Plus the
  language-agnostic gates (check-control-bindings, sbom, smoke/doctor) as the phase needs. Tee
  logs into reports/<SLUG>/logs/<N>-<slug>.log
Return: the fixed return envelope of the sub-agent context contract
  (docs/sdlc/agent-handoff-schema.md › Sub-agent context contract) — artefacts/files_changed (real
  paths in CODE / reports/<SLUG>/ in DRY-RUN), commands run, evidence excerpts (≤20 lines), gate
  PASS/FAIL/N-A/BLOCKED/WAIVED (DRY-RUN Phase 6 may be SIMULATED) with reason + gate_counts,
  spec_deviations (open SPEC_DEVIATION markers) or none, issues or none, tier_escalation or none,
  any human gate hit (with payload), `restored` (DRY-RUN tracked files reverted, or none), and
  per-task wall-clock (start/end ISO-8601).
""")
```

Record each task's **start and end timestamps** (the orchestrator brackets each Task call).
In **CODE** mode, when an executor returns `gate: BLOCKED` for a human gate (push/merge/
release/deploy/flag-change or a §14 trigger), **STOP the run**, surface the gate line and its
payload, and wait for explicit human approval before continuing to the next phase.

### HITL enforcement (every phase boundary + every intercepted action)

At each phase boundary, and for any action `src/agents/hitl_gateway.py` would intercept
(consequential/real-world effects — deploy, release, outbound messages, ACL/flag changes),
**PAUSE** and emit a gate line. **Never silently bypass a gate** (CLAUDE.md §14, ADR-0011/0034).

- **DRY-RUN:** do not block — log
  `HITL: auto-approved (dry-run) — payload: <what would have needed a human>` and append it to
  the open-HITL list.
- **CODE:** this is a **real STOP**. Emit the gate line, halt file writes, surface the payload,
  and wait for the human to approve/modify/cancel in this session before proceeding. Never
  auto-approve a gate in CODE mode.

### Mode invariants (hard rules)

**Both modes:**

- **Never autonomously** `git push`, open/merge a PR, tag, release, deploy, roll back, or
  change a feature-flag/ACL/autonomy setting — these always require an explicit human gate
  (CLAUDE.md §3/§14; ADR-0011/0015/0034). DRY-RUN simulates-and-logs them; CODE STOPs on them.
- Evidence = running the repo's **own** validation targets and tee-ing output → `reports/<SLUG>/logs/`.
  Pick the **LANGUAGE-appropriate** lint/unit targets (PYTHON `lint-python`/`test-unit-python`/
  `test-security-python`; JAVA `lint-java`/`test-unit-java SERVICE=`; GO `lint-go`/`test-unit-go
SERVICE=`; NODE|TS `lint-frontend`/`test-unit-frontend APP=`; IAC terraform validate + Checkov /
  ansible-lint — see **Languages**), plus the **language-agnostic** gates as the phase needs
  (`make check-control-bindings`, `make sbom`, `make smoke`/`make doctor`).
- One spec, one LANGUAGE per invocation; honour the 2-skill budget per task (ADR-0060).

**DRY-RUN only:**

- **No real side-effects:** all artefacts stay under `reports/<SLUG>/`; never write `src/`,
  `tests/`, `docs/`, `infrastructure/`, `.github/`. Simulate every irreversible/HITL action.
- **Side-effect-safe validation (snapshot & restore).** The repo's validation targets can
  _incidentally_ mutate **tracked** files — e.g. `make lint-python` → `detect-secrets` rewrites
  `.secrets.baseline`'s `generated_at`; `make test-*`/`uv run` may rewrite `uv.lock` drift. These
  are real tracked-tree writes and violate the DRY-RUN invariant. Therefore:
  1. **Before** launching any phase, the orchestrator records a baseline `git status --porcelain`
     (the set of files already dirty — typically empty, but may contain unrelated WIP).
  2. **After** the run (and ideally after each make-running phase), compute the **delta**: tracked
     files that were _clean at baseline_ but became dirty during the run, and restore exactly
     those with `git checkout -- <path>`. Also remove any **new untracked** files a target wrote
     outside the sandbox (e.g. `sbom.cyclonedx.json`, `.coverage`) — `git checkout` does not touch
     untracked files, so a tracked-only restore leaves these behind. The gitignored
     `reports/<SLUG>/` sandbox is the only intended output and is **always** left in place.
  3. **Never** revert a file that was already dirty at baseline (pre-existing WIP) — restore the
     delta only. End the run by asserting the tracked tree equals the baseline.
  4. **This snapshot/restore is DRY-RUN-only.** It is the orchestrator's job; the per-phase
     executor restores what _it_ dirtied, and this close-out is the authoritative backstop against
     the Phase-0 baseline. In **CODE** the working-tree changes are the deliverable — see below.

**CODE only:**

- Implementation **is** the deliverable: write real code/tests/ADRs/docs/migrations into their
  canonical locations (local, **uncommitted**). Required validation gates are enforced for
  real — a failing lint/test/security/coverage gate is a `FAIL`, not a note.
- Keep guardrails unmodified or strengthened, never weakened. Touching `src/guardrails/` or
  `src/agents/hitl_gateway.py` trips a §14 dual-approval STOP.
- **Never `git checkout`/revert/`git clean` the working tree in CODE** — the changes ARE the
  deliverable; the snapshot/restore rule above is **DRY-RUN-only**. The one thing to reconcile is
  _incidental_ tooling churn (e.g. `.secrets.baseline` timestamp): leave it if it belongs with the
  change, revert just that file if it doesn't — never touch the implemented `src/`/`tests/` edits.
- Leave changes in the working tree **uncommitted and unstaged** for human review (no `git add`/
  commit/push). The human reviews the tree and drives Phases 7/12/13 (review-merge, release,
  deploy) themselves.
- Beyond the working-tree implementation, cause **no** real-world side-effects at all — no
  outbound calls, no writes outside the repo, no external mutation — not just the named
  push/merge/deploy/flag actions.

### FINAL-REPORT

Write the FINAL-REPORT containing, in order (W13-T6, issue #371):

- **DRY-RUN** → `reports/<SLUG>/FINAL-REPORT.md` (gitignored sandbox, as before).
- **CODE** → `docs/delivery/<SPEC-ID>/FINAL-REPORT.md` (**tracked**; `<SPEC-ID>` is the spec's
  frontmatter `id:`, ADR-0085) plus `docs/delivery/<SPEC-ID>/logs/`. The report is validated by
  `scripts/governance/check_delivery_report.py` (`make check-delivery-report
  REPORT=docs/delivery/<SPEC-ID>/FINAL-REPORT.md`): the spec id must be in the generated
  registry, every ADR cited must exist, every evidence path must resolve, and the Ambiguity
  ledger must have no blocking open question or overdue assumption.


0. **Run header** — `MODE` (DRY-RUN | CODE), `TIER` (TRIVIAL | STANDARD | GOVERNED | REGULATED, the
   ADR-0064 scope axis — and the _effective_ tier if the safety valve escalated), `LANGUAGE` (+ the
   code location & validation targets it mapped to), spec path, SLUG, (DRY-RUN) the tracked files
   restored at close-out, and (CODE) the list of human gates the run STOPPED at and their resolution.
1. **Summary + gate results** — one line per phase: phase, gate (**PASS/FAIL/N-A/BLOCKED**, plus
   **SIMULATED** for a DRY-RUN Phase 6, and **WAIVED** for a process phase the tier waived —
   carrying its `PHASE_WAIVED` reason), human-equiv approver. **List every `TIER_ESCALATION`**
   (ADR-0064 safety valve) as its own line: `from → to`, the trigger that fired, and the phases
   re-entered — so any mid-run promotion is auditable. Control phases are never WAIVED.
2. **Requirement-traceability table** — `| Criterion | Phase | ADR(s) | Evidence (log/path) |`
   (one row per acceptance criterion from the backlog/spec).
3. **Task/sub-task table** —
   `| ID | Task | Phase | ADRs | Agent wall-clock | Human-equiv estimate | Status |`
   - _Agent wall-clock_ = end − start from the recorded timestamps.
   - _Human-equiv estimate_ = from `estimate_tshirt`: **XS≈0.5h · S≈2h · M≈4h · L≈8h · XL≈24h**,
     and **clearly label the column an ESTIMATE**.
   - End with **totals** for both columns and a **speedup ratio** (human-equiv ÷ agent wall-clock).
4. **Evidence appendix** — log excerpts, **≤ 20 lines each**, referencing files in `logs/`.
5. **Open-HITL-items list** — every gate that would need a real human, with its payload.
6. **Ambiguity ledger** (W13-T9) — the union of every phase's `open_questions` and `assumptions`
   from the return envelopes, one row each (`| Phase | Kind | Item | Owner | Resolve by | Status |`),
   plus the per-phase `confidence`. A CODE run with any `blocking: true` open question or any
   `open` assumption past its resolve-by phase ends with `gate: BLOCKED`, not a green report.

### Close-out — restore the tracked tree (DRY-RUN)

**DRY-RUN** — after writing the FINAL-REPORT, diff the current `git status --porcelain` against the
`logs/00-tree-baseline.txt` snapshot. **Restore the delta** — `git checkout -- <path>` for every
tracked file that was clean at baseline but is now dirty (e.g. `.secrets.baseline`, `uv.lock`
touched by `detect-secrets`/`uv run`), and remove new untracked artefacts written outside the
sandbox. Leave baseline-dirty files and the gitignored `reports/<SLUG>/` sandbox untouched. Report
the restored paths in the run header, then confirm the tracked tree matches the baseline.

**CODE** — do **not** restore: the working-tree changes ARE the deliverable, so reverting them
would destroy the work. Only verify the change set is the intended one and that any _incidental_
tooling churn (e.g. `.secrets.baseline` timestamp) is reconciled. Never run `git checkout`/`git
clean` over the implementation.

## Guardrails for the orchestrator itself

- One spec per invocation. **You** (the orchestrator) do not write product code yourself — in
  CODE mode the `phase-executor` subagent performs the implementation; you plan, brief, gate,
  and report. In DRY-RUN no `src/` is touched at all.
- Honour `CLAUDE.md §14` escalation triggers; if one fires, emit `[HITL-ESCALATE]` and stop —
  in **both** modes.
- Never push, merge, tag, release, deploy, or change a flag/autonomy setting without an
  explicit human approval in this session — regardless of mode.
- Respect the 2-skill budget per task (ADR-0060) when briefing the executor.
