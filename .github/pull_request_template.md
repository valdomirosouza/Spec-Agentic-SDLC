## Summary

<!-- One paragraph description of the change and its purpose -->

## Workflow Compliance (CLAUDE.md §2)

_Confirm the mandatory 10-step SDD cycle was followed before code was written:_

- [ ] **Step 1 — Spec read:** Relevant spec in `specs/` read before coding started; spec exists or was written first
- [ ] **Step 2 — ADRs read:** Relevant ADRs in `docs/adr/` reviewed; no architectural violations
- [ ] **Step 3 — Glossary checked:** All terms verified against `docs/glossary.md`
- [ ] **Step 4 — Issue exists:** GitHub Issue filed and linked below; spec referenced in issue
- [ ] **Step 5 — Privacy checked:** DPIA/RIPD review flagged if new PII processing introduced
- [ ] **Step 6 — Implemented:** Code follows spec; no gold-plating or scope creep
- [ ] **Step 7 — Tests written:** Unit coverage ≥ 80%; integration tests for service boundaries
- [ ] **Step 8 — Guardrails run:** `pii_filter`, `prompt_injection_guard`, `audit_logger` verified
- [ ] **Step 9 — ADR updated:** New ADR filed if an architectural decision was made
- [ ] **Step 10 — CHANGELOG:** nothing to do by hand — release-please generates it from the Conventional-Commit PR title (RFC-0012)

> Blocking CI gates are the jobs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `pr-governance.yml` (registry: `docs/governance/gate-lifecycle.md`). `harness/code-check.yml` is the Claude Code review-agent spec, not a CI runner (see W12-T8).
