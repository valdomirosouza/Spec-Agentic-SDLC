# Skills Catalog

Skills are reusable Claude Code instruction sets for recurring domain tasks in this repository. When a task matches a skill domain, Claude loads and follows that skill before proceeding.

## How Skills Work

Skills are activated automatically based on the task context, as defined in the **Skill Activation Table** in `CLAUDE.md`. Each skill file contains domain-specific guidance, checklists, and patterns that Claude applies during implementation.

You can also reference a skill explicitly by mentioning it in your request.

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create `skills/<domain>/<skill-name>.md` with substantive guidance
2. Add a row to the catalog table above
3. Add a row to the Skill Activation Table in `CLAUDE.md`
4. Reference in `specs/` if the skill governs a spec domain

Skills files are owned by `@org/tech-lead` (see `.github/CODEOWNERS`).
