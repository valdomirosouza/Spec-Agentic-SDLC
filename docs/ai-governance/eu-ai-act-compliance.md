## System Risk Classification

| Criterion                                          | Assessment                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Autonomous decision-making with real-world effects | Yes — agents propose and execute actions                |
| Oversight by humans before consequential actions   | Yes — HITL gateway mandatory (ADR-0011)                 |
| Potential impact on individuals                    | Medium — actions affect user data and external services |
| **Classification**                                 | **High-Risk — Arts. 9, 12, 13, 14 apply**               |
